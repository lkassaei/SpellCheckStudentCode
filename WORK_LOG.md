I started a helper function but didn't get too far before class ended. |
| Sept 27 | 5:30-6:30pm | I started coding my binary search function using the high low and mid values of where I was looking in the dictionary. After I ran it, I realized that I was getting way higher numbers that I was supposed to be getting. My instinct was that my code was wrong, but upon looking at it, I figured out that my logic was correct, but I was over-counting misspelled words. To fix this, I added a new ArrayList of all the words that I had visited, and checked if a word was present in that array before adding it to my misspelled array. I also figured out a more abstract way to copy my ArrayList mispelled word values into a normal String array by using the .toArray(new String[0]) function. After this, everything worked! My benchmark runtime is around 2-3 seconds so I will brainstorm how to make that more efficient. |

I made sure to handle both duplicates and apostrophes, but I still am failing 2 test cases by a slight amount. I am planning to get this checked out in class and in tutorial before I start my TST approach. |

After implementing this, everything worked! |
